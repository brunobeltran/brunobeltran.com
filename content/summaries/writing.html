    Almost everything that I would normally have made into a blog post is either
    a coding tutorial (see my <a href="#code"> code </a> page) or has now become
    a published paper (see my <a href="#science">science</a> page).

    However, if you are interested in the philosophy of science, perhaps you'll
    find something worthwhile here...
