My research has spanned several fields, from semigroup theory to bacterial
cell size control, and from statistics to modeling chromatin organization.
<br />
Below, I highlight some recent projects:
<!--TODO: make invisble section containing this text if necessary
<br />
Under Dr. Andrew Spakowitz, I developed coarse-grained models for chromatin
that include realistic nucleosome spacing with the help of an extremely talented
undegraduate (Deepti Kannan). I studied the link between chromatin's
"compartmental organization" and epigenetic information in collaboration with
Quinn MacPherson. I contributed to multiple projects investigating the dynamics
of epigenetic mark spreading with Sarah Sandholtz. Finally, I contributed
analysis, experiments, and statistical method development to a collaboration
with the Burgess lab at UC Davis studying the mechanism of meiotic homolog
recombination.
<br />
Under Dr. Christine Jacobs-Wagner, I studied cell size control, chromosome
segregation and the effects of supercoiling on transcription (all in bacteria).
<br />
Under Drs. Castillo-Chavez and Baojun Song, I used fluid simulation to study
aneurysm formation.
<br />
Under Dr. Frank Neubrander, I studied new bounds for rational Pade approximants
to operator semigroups, with applications to Laplace inversion.
