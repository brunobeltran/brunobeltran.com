Analysis of high-throughput movies of <i>C. crescentus</i> and <i>E.
coli</i> growth were used to show that bacterial populations control their
average cell size not by timing how long the cells have lived, not by measuring
a specific cell size that triggers division, but via a random process where
each cell simply grows the same amount on average.
