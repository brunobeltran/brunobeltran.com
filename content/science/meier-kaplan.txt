Historically, the Meier-Kaplan correction has been used whenever an experiment
measure "lifetimes" that are "right-censored" (meaning you stop observing before
the event you're waiting for happens). However, not all right-censored waiting
times are correctly treated by the Meier-Kaplan approach. We have developed a
generalized framework for easily classifying right-censored waiting times, and a
simple, fast algorithm for generating correct survival curves (or histograms) of
real measured lifetimes. A Python package implementing these corrections can be
