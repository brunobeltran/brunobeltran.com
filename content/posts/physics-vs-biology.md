### Why do physicists and biologists talk past each other?

Every researcher that interfaces with the
work that might be classified as
"biophysics" is likely to have a strong
opinion about this question. But I think
that there's a simple-to-express distinction
between the <em>goals</em> of biology and
the <em>goals</em> of physics that easily
explains some 99% of the examples I've run
into of physicists and biologists
misunderstanding (or just disagreeing with)
each other.

<strong>Physicists care about
    universality. Biologists care about
    actuality.</strong>

Both physicists coming into biology and
biologists starting to apply physical
principles to their research would be
well-served by trying to understand the
perspective of the other. In particular,
this rant is written largely at ph

Historically, physicists have had a
reasonably clear (if difficult to define)
goal in mind: to characterize the extremely
complex world around us into the simplest
set of universal rules that can be used to
plausibly explain everything that we
observe. Biologists, on the other hand, have
had a very different goal: to figure out
exactly how it is that life works, whether
or not such a description admits a
low-complexity representation.

Centuries of working towards their unique
goals have led biologists and physicists to
develop a deep intuitions as fields for what
types of scientific questions tend to be
fruitful, and which tend to turn up nothing
of interest (or just be wild goose chases).
However, the differences between their

A physicist will think a problem/system is
interesting <em>if and only if</em> the
problem admits a solution/description that
can be broadly generalized to a larger
system of problems. Physicists will often
speak of a problem or solution have a kind
of "elegance". After working with more and
more physicists, I think that I've basically
found that what is meant by elegance is just
what mathematicians might call
"universality", or the discovery that a
complex system can be simply described by a
simple set of rules.

On the other hand, a biologist
