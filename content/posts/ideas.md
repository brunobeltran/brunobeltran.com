# Colloquial words in science

Appropriating common words for science purposes is bad
1. because by-fiat language change is "hard" (see: gender)
2. because it leads to confusion and distracts from real work that needs to be
   done in the field (see: rationality)
3. it facilitates bad journalism: allows "mixing" of science and common words
   into a single sentence

# Math words belong in math land

Using math words for scientific results is bad, because science is not a field
where logic applies. it's a field of heuristics.

# Do social scientists tend to overreach?

The more complex the system you're trying to study is, the easier it is to make
the mistake over over-applying your own theory...especially if you use bad words
(colloquial-words-in-science.md).

# I don't see the problem with quantum mechanical foundations

And it's not because I haven't read enough "real" quantum mechanics
...
Nobody would complain about a vibrating string, if I asked you to measure it's
wavemodes, that you had to do some complicated procedure in order to extract
them. or measure its entire set of positions and compute them. Do the amplitudes
of the wavemodes not "exist"? well, just like the positions of the string, they
are simply an observable quantity that maps onto a mathematical object that we
use to model this string's motion. it just happens that they don't map easily
onto the intuitive human notion of "sets of atoms that move together under
force".
...
So why complain that you need to "measure" the wavefunction in order to collapse
it? is the wavefunction "real"? I argue that's the same kind of silliness. The
actual quantities we observe, the electrons and the forces and the photons, etc.
Those are real observables. What mathematical objects we choose to use to
describe them have no bearing on what parts of them actually physically
exist....and probably this is all down to the word "measurement" having the
colloquial-words-in-science.md problem.

# "Hard" science is "good" science

Among scientists, you will often hear the word "hard" used as a compliment about
someone's work. Sometimes substituted with the word "real", these are among the
highest compliments someone can use to describe a scientific work's intrinsic
worth (without referring to its broader implications). But what is meant by
that?
1. sequencing the human genome was "hard"/"great"
2. measuring the distance over time of the earth with a particular asteroid
   would be colloquially hard, but useless.
3. Observing an obscure invariant can be difficult, but what makes it "hard" is
   if the invariant doesn't trivially follow from
