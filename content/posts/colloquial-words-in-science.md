### The best way to create pseudoscience

Is imprecise language.

Okay, maybe multi-million-dollar misinformation campaigns can also be very
effective.  But I would argue that imprecise language damaged science in the
20th century at least as much as the cigarette and oil lobbies.

There are innumerable ways that impercise language can lead to pseudoscience.
For one, simple gaffs from prominent scientists can often be enough. After all,
if I asked my family back home what the tone of a typical scientist makes them
feel, they would probably complain that scientists always seem to want
people to know "I am right, whether you like it or not". People can forgive
mistakes, but when they feel spoken down to, even the smallest mistakes can
be made grounds for complete dismissal of an idea.

On the other hand, I dare anyone to name a single language issue that plagues
science more at the turn of the 21st century than attempts to appropriate common
words into the scientific parlance (its less-insidious converse: trying to
introduce scientific definitions to the public via too-simple analogies, is more
well known).

If you need convincing that this is the case, I've provided in what follows
three diverse examples of the kinds of issues that arise when common language
words are given new, "more rigorous" definitions by scientists. One from the
[social sciences](#gender-example), one from [game
theory](#game-theory-example), and one from [quantum
mechanics](#quantum-example). I close with some of my thoughts about
[how to prevent these issues in the first place](#prevention-tips).

I especially try to demonstrate with [an example from game
theory](#game-theory-example) how trying to come up with scientific definitions
of common words) tends to lead to incredibly persistent miscommunication, *even
among other scientists in the same field*. However, to see how pernicious this
problem can really be, we'll first examine the damage that can be done when the
confused party is instead the general public.

For non-scientist readers, hopefully this is a window that helps you see the
ways in which common journalistic practices in "pop-science" can easily deceive
you. For scientist readers, I hope to convince you that if a word is already in
common use, and you try to give it a rigorous definition, no matter how well
intentioned you may be, or how close that word is to capturing the colloquial
meaning, at best you're going to cause confusion, and at worst you're going to
piss people off.

Most
of us run into harmless examples of this constantly. Every stoned undergraduate
asking their new physics major friend right now whether telepathy is possible,
since quantum mechanics "allows things to be in two places at once" is simply
emulating what he thinks he sees scientists do already! "Why can't it be true?"
he'll argue. "I saw a show on the Science channel that described
\[chaos/non-locality/energy/rationality\], I know it's true!". By mixing
together scientific and non-scientific meanings of words in a single sentence,
they've created what we in the business like to call
[woo woo](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Science_woo).

<!--
newer version:
Most of us run into the reverse direction all too much (typically on Facebook,
or other social media), in the form of people trying to use well-defined
scientiic words like "entanglement" to promote this or the other new-age
[woo woo](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Science_woo). While it can sometimes be
hard to muster the energy to have these confrontations, they're easy enough to
deal with: "That analogy you're using is useful for teaching, but the actual
theory is much more complicated (and predicts X)".
-->

An obvious example of this worst-case has unfortunately already played out with
the word "gender". Social scientists now [uniformly use this
word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) to refer to the socially-constructed
aspects of the ideas colloquially referred to as masculinity and femininity.
However, before the 1950s, the word gender [was already use, and referred only
to grammatical
categories](https://web.archive.org/web/20120615160110/http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/haig/Publications_files/04InexorableRise.pdf).
In many places, for example in the southern United States (where I went to
university), this old convention is still the only way the word is commonly used
(especially among those above the age of 30).

There is no better way to sow confusion and division than to walk into somebody
else's house and use a language
-->
There is no better way to alienate someone on a topic than to start by trying to
convince them that a word they've been using their whole life suddenly has a new
definition ([entire comedy
routines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m-zHjZ011I) are based off of this
fact). While the abuses that continue to be perpretrated towards trans and
non-binary peoples in the South are totally inexcusable, I have personally seen
countless potential allies (especially religious people) driven away from LGBT+
issues due to simple misunderstandings caused by well-intentioned attempts to
change language by fiat.

It's easy to forget in the modern age, when the word "gender" is much more
present in the popular consciousness, but there was a day when it was impossible
to say that someone who refused to use this new definition of gender was
"bigoted". The word already had a meaning, and depending on how it was initially
presented to someone fifty years ago, they may have had various, perfectly
non-bigoted reasons not to use it.

But don't think for a second that this is something that can only happen in the
social sciences. Non-social scientists often feel immune to this type of problem
due to a perception that they are "rigorous" enough to not fall into these types
of traps. But as we'll see that is far from the case.

Nor should you get the idea that this problem cannot be avoided, after all,
nobody has ever accidentally gone to the jewerly store at the behest of a
mathematician asking them to study some property of
["rings"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics), so clearly it's
possible to prevent prevent confusion between scientific and colloquial
homographs

<!--
As scientists, we are free to choose any words we like to describe the
observations we make of the world around us, and we typically rely on the
scientific community to prevent us from using overly grandiose or otherwise
confusing verbiage. But this is not enough. As scientists, we have a
responsibility to communicate to the public the distinction between scientific
claims and definitions and their colloquial and political interpretations and
conclusions.

Nobody gets upset that mathematicians call the real numbers under multiplication
and addition a "ring", even though that word is already *very much* taken. But
that's because you'll never hear a mathematician trying to use this definition
in a jewelry store.
-->

*(Disclaimer: thankfully, the sociologist's definition of the word "gender"
seems to be on track to become well-accepted within the next generation. I fully
support the charge to normalize this word in the public mind, as whatever
problems may have occured due to the initial pushback against this usage now
pale in comparison to the practical need to adopt a word that, for example,
trans and non-binary people can use to accurately describe their experiences.

That said, if I could go back to 1955 and talk to [John
Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money), I would plead that he choose a
different word.)*

<!--
The most common place to find examples examples an unfortunately chosen word "rationality" from game
theory. Many counter-intuitive results (such as always defecting in the
iterated prisoner's dilemma) are only counter-intuitive because the
colloquial definition of the word "rational" is different enough from the
game theoretic definition to cause confusion, not because the result doesn't
make perfect sense when explained in other words.

#### The finite iterated prisoners dilemma
</span>

*If you're already familiar with the Nash equilibrium of the finite iterated
prisoner's dilemma, feel free to [skip here](#after-finite-prisoner-nash).*

Suppose you're on a game show. A celebrity moderator stands between you and your
"opponent". The rules of the game are simple: each turn, you each press one of
two buttons. If you both press the "A" button, you both get $100,000. If you
both press the "B" button, you each get a measly $10,000.

Easy enough? Except that if you betray the other person (by presses "B"
when they press "A"), you gain $150,000 instead of $100,000! Now that's a lot of
extra money (almost two years of a graduate student salary, if anyone's asking).

![Prisoner's dilemma grid: with the four possibilities (A,A), (A,B), (B, A) and
(B,B) drawn out](./images/prisoners-dilemma-box.svg)

In real life, this could be a reasonably tense game show. With lots of pleading,
promises (sometimes broken) and potentially many tears. But suppose now that
instead of being out on a stage, with a celebrity host and a cheering crowd,
you're instead playing from inside an interrogation room. All you were told
about your opponent is that you've never met them. The windows are blacked out
and the only contact you have with the outside world is the two buttons in front
of you, and a timer above you, telling you how much longer you have to make your
final choice.

**What should you do?**

Suppose your goal is to make as much money as possible, and you've been told
there are ten turns. What is the rational thing to do? Is there a "rational"
thing to do?

If you've taken microeconomics or read about game theory (or are particularly
cynical), you'll recogize that if there was only one turn, you are always
"better off" pressing "B". You have no control over what your opponent will do,
but we can think about what will happen for each of their two options.

Suppose your opponent presses "A". Then if you press "B", you get $50,000 more
than if you press "A"! If they are going to press "B", then you may only get
$10,000 for pressing "B", but it's better than the **$0** you would get for
pressing "A". *So in either case you're strictly better off pressing "B"*.

This is microeconomic's favorite "unintuitive" result. Just like a statistics
professor presenting the [birthday
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem), a econ professor must
typically jump through several hoops to convince the class that while they may
not think it's "right" to defect and press "B", it is the strictly more
"rational" decision. And so we arrive at the definition of "rationality" used in
game theory: if there is a choice present that has a reward strictly higher
than any other choice, regardless of what the opponent does (a strictly dominant
strategy), a "rational" player will always choose such a strictly dominant
strategy. In other words, the player is rational if they can follow the train of
thought above.

This may seem like a pretty good definition of the word rational. After all, why
would a "rational" agent ever do something not in their best interest? That is,
however, until you ask how the original game plays out if both players are
"rational". Obviously on the last turn, the game is equivalent to the one turn
version, so both players will choose "B". But then if the last turn of the game
is fixed, the second to last turn is also equivalent to the one-turn case, since
the players don't have to take the last turn into consideration (they're both
rational and know each other are rational, so they can deduce what the outcome will
be for the last turn). So that means only the second-to-last turn matters in
isolation, so the players also both choose "B" on the second to last turn, and
on the third-to-last turn, and so on and so on.

This may seem like a sneaky argument, but [a rigorous version of this analysis
exists (it's called "backwards
induction")](https://economics.mit.edu/files/4754), and it can
be used to prove that in any finite (fixed number of turns) prisoner's dilemma,
no matter how many turns there are, two "rational" players, for this game
theoretic definition of "rational", will always play "B".

And depending on your risk tolerance, this might make some sense intuitively,
after all, walking away with with 10\*$10,000 is a pretty sweet deal, and maybe
better than $0 to some theoretical "rational" agent.

<span id="after-finite-prisoner-nash">
However, changing the game slightly makes this result totally nonsensical to
most people
</span>

![Prisoner's dilemma grid: with the four possibilities (A,A), (A,B), (B, A) and
(B,B) drawn out. This time the prize for defecting is only $1.](./images/prisoners-dilemma-box-2.svg)

If the prize for both people defecting is only one dollar, you'd be hard pressed
to find anyone that would agree that the "rational" choice is to always defect.
In fact, almost any other strategy will do better! So is game theory wrong?

Well, of course not, game theory is a mathematical framework, it simply tells us
the logical conclusions given the definitions that we have laid out. On the one
hand, it could be argued that the fact that the game theoretic version of
"rationality" doesn't align with our colloquial understanding of the word is not
a problem. After all, as long as we're clear on which version of the word we're
using, we should be fine right?

On the other hand, I'm sure it's clear how it can be extremely easy to see how
this definition of rationality could be incorrectly used in a headline: "game
theory teaches us that betrayal is rational". Anybody who tries to claim that
such a headline is purely the fault of a subpar journalist has never tried to
teach game thoery. When you have to spend most of the class hammering home the
ideas that "humans aren't rational", and "that strategy does make the most
sense, but it's not technically 'rational', because...", at some point I think
you have to realize that the problem is not with the students, but with the
choice of words being taught.

Even successful game theorists have been known to accidentally tie themselves
into knots trying to explain how to best interpret counterintuitive results on
rationality, forgetting that "rational" is just a mathematical concept that we
happened to choose an extremely loaded word for, and that game theory does not
provide any guidance about what rationality "should" mean, nor about the
faculties that govern human reason (the traditional meaning of the word
rationality).

A great example of this very issue can be found towards the end of the
excellent book by Martin Osborne and Ariel Rubinstein, "A Course in Game
Theory". The authors come to such disagreement about how to intepret the
experimental result that humans act as if there were an infinite number of turns
(i.e., they do not choose to defect immediately) that they include in the book
itself a back and forth with each other (starting on page 135). Their
disagreement fundamentally boils down to the question of whether or not it makes
sense to model human interactions in the finite prisoners dilemma using the
methods described above. And, well, of course it doesn't. There's a whole field
of economics ([behavioral game
thoery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_game_theory)) devoted to how
far human reason is from game theory's definition of "rational".

So even scientists are not immune to the dangers of misappropriated words.

And if you think that economics is still too much of a social science to count
as an example of word misappropriation by the hard sciences, let's talk about:

<span id="quantum-example">
#### The example of quantum "foundations"
</span>

While I don't have nearly enough room in a blog post to defend such a thesis, I
can't resist writing this, if only to piss off my philosophy of physics friends.

There is an absolute boatload of human time devoted to explaining (and trying to
solve) various problems at the "heart" of quantum mechanics, collectively known
as the "foundations of quantum mechanics". If you've heard of the many-worlds
interpretation, the copenhagen interpretation, the measurement problem, or other
"paradoxes" of quantum mechanics, you've been exposed to these ideas before.

I think that the whole business of trying to "solve" these paradoxes is just
another waste of time that is distracted perfectly good minds from attacking
real, useful problems. I think that once you start to carefully frame these
problems from within any reasonable, [logically consistent model for what
science "is"](#defining-science), the problems completely go away.

What do I mean by that? And how does it tie into the problem of trying to
rigorously define common words?

Let's take the measurement problem for example. People always complain that the
quantum wavefunctions needs someone to "measure" them in order to produce
"observables". As David Albert recounts to Sean Carroll in Carroll's excellent
[podcast](https://youtu.be/AglOFx6eySE?t=1780), even prominent, Nobel-winning
physicists like Wigner have been known to speculate totally wacky-sounding ideas
in response to this "problem". Even going as far as to claim thing to the effect
of "dogs could likely collapse wavefunctions, but mice probably not".

But the framing of the measurement problem itself has a problem.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem)
defines the measurement problem as "the problem of how (or *whether*) wave
function collapse occurs".
<!--
The idea that
quantum wavefunctions need someone to measure them to produce "observables" is
true, but only because "observable" actually secretly has a very specific
mathematical definition in the theory of quantum mechanics, and mathematically
speaking, wave function collapse is *defined* to be the process of computing an
observable from the wafefunction. This is not the phrasing typically used to
describe the theory in "pop-science" accounts of quantum mechanics (probably
because it makes the whole set of conclusions seem much more "boring" and
"technical"), but "experimental observable" in quantum mechanics does not mean
what most people would think it does. It does not mean that an actual person
needs to be in charge of an actual conscious body that designed an actual
experiment that is now being carried out in order for the wavefunction to
collapse.

Quantum theory can predict the interactions between a set of quantum particles
in a theoretical universe with no life in it just as easily as it can predict
their interactions in our own universe. Say that you want to compute one of
these mathematical objects (quantum mechanical "observables") in this alteranate
universe, and say we want to assume that one of the particles in this universe
begins its life far away from the others, as if shot from a laser in a distant
galaxy. Then if you ask what happens to the system when this particle collides
with the rest of the particles in it's "universe", you would see that the
wavefunction would be predicted to "collapse", totally free from human
"measurement" in that universe.

It took me several hours to carefully write this last paragraph to minimally
piss off any QM experts that might read this blog post. But why? I claim it's
because the decision to refer to different mathematical components of the
theory of quantum mechanics by words that are loaded with colloquial meaning
(like "observable", "state", etc) have made it arbitrarily hard to talk about
the implications of the theory, when that need not be the case.
-->

<!--
A quantum wavefunction is quite an esoteric mathematical object. If you take
appropriate limits, you can recover classical mechanics: a physical theory
describing objects as having a single, definite positions and momenta, for
example. If you track backwards those terms into the full quantum mechanical
framework, you can continue to use the words "position" and "momentum" for the
appropriate corresponding terms in the equations. However, if you do so you
start to see some weird consequences. Like things occupying "two positions at
once". But the quantum mechanical theory does **NOT** say that there are two
copies of some macroscopic physical object, one present at each of those two
locations. It tells us that, whatever it is that is really going on, however the
rules of the universe cause it to evolve, it acts the same as if the object we
normally call a particle was actually spread out in this "wavefunction" that
covers space, and is no longer localized to a point, as in classical mechanics.
-->
To explain why this is a silly question, I'll use a simple (if slightly flawed)
analogy.
<!--
What is the wavefunction? It's a mathematical object from the theory of quantum
mechanics.
-->

In the theory of polymers, there is the notion of a "Rouse" polymer. Any
polymer, when made sufficiently long, will be described well by the "Rouse"
polymer model. However, the "Rouse" polymer itself (as a mathematical object)
looks like a fractal, random walk through space with infinite energy. Obviously,
there is no sense in which a strand of DNA looks like an infinitely jagged
fractal path. If we zoom in enough, we will see individual base pairs (and
eventually individual atoms) which do not resemble linear fractals in the
slightest. However, DNA is a polymer, and sure enough, the Rouse polymer model
has been wildly successful at describing its behavior on long length scales.

Similarly, quantum mechanics has been a hugely successful theory, and the
mathematical object at its center is known as the wavefunction. This obviously
does not have any bearing on whether there "is" such a wavefunction, to which me
must actually assign some higher ontological status beyond its mathematical
utility for calculating things that we observe in our actual universe.

In this sense, asking whether the wavefunction "actually" collapses makes a
[category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake). The
wavefunction that most physicists know and love is a mathematical object, not a
physical one. Asking whether it "actually" collapses sneaks in the assumption
that it "actually" exists.

So why not go and try to measure it then? Well the real crux of the issue is
that it is *logically inconsistent* to measure the wavefunction directly
according to the theory of quantum mechanics. It doesn't even make sense to ask
the math that kind of question. Which doesn't mean that it's impossible to ever
know whether or not there is a measurable, high-dimensional wave-like that
permeates space-time. It just means that if it is possible to ask such a
question, it requires a more general theory which we do not currently have.

Until then, people asking whether or not the wavefunction "really" collapses are
**wasting their time**.

<!--
So in that case why are people trying
What "is" are the things that we actually observe with experiments. It makes no
more sense to say that the wavefunction necessarily "is" than it makes sense to
say that the vector of normal modes of a vibrating string "is". You can describe
a vibrating string in terms of it's positions over time, or equivalently by the
amplitudes of its normal modes. That doesn't make either of these mathematical
descriptions any more "real". They are, at the end of the day, just equivalent
mathematical objects that therefore map equally well onto
-->

But what does this have to do with trying to assign rigorous, scientific meaning
to common words? Well, quantum theory is a zoo of such assignments. The most
relevant to the measurement problem is the definition of the word "observable".

The definition of a "measurement" in quantum mechanics is typically given to be
"anything which is an observable". And while this may seem like a play on words
from outside of the theory, it turns out to make sense because in quantum
theory, the word "observable" actually has a very specific mathematical
definition (a self-adjoint Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space of "states").

I cannot speak to what drove Wigner to postulate that dogs may be capable of
"observing" the wavefunction, yet mice not so much. But I can say that if you
teach quantum mechanics for long enough, you notice that time and time again,
students will come to you with questions about the philosophy of quantum
mechanics that accidentally treat this mathematical model of "observables" as
corresponding to the intuitive notion of actually performing a physical
measurement out in the world.

Most of these students go on to become successful practioners of quantum
mechanics, but some unfortunate few end up wasting years of their life
unnecessarily pondering silly questions like the "ontological status of
measurement".

#### How to carefully appropriate words
</span>

So what do we do about this issue? We've seen that not being careful about our
choice of words can lead to (in vaguely increasing order of insidiousness)

1. Wasting good minds on useless philosophical interpretations of perfectly
   well-defined (if complex) topics
2. Misapplying scientific results to situations they were never designed to be
3. Completely alienating the public

Is the answer really to have better foresight about how our definitions might be
misinterpreted? I, for one, don't think so. While it is encumbent on scientists to
police themselves to prevent egregiously confusing terms from coming into common
use in the first place, no matter how hard you try, you're never going to
be able to accurately predict the connotations society as a whole will assign to
a word after you start using it in a new way.

Here are a few thoughts from my own personal experience:

1. **Be up front**: if you're not sure that your audience is aware of the actual
   process underlying supervised neural networks, don't just say ["this AI has
   *learned* to understand what criminal faces looked
   like"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04135).  I am usually against the use of
   jargon, but make sure that you use words that are clearly technical so that
   nobody can think that you mean (for example) "learning" in the colloquial
   sense as opposed to "extracted statistical patterns from human labelings of
   who is or is not a criminal".
2. **Stand up against misuse**: because let's face it, "A description of
   statistical patterns in faces humans classify as 'criminal'" is much less
   sexy than "AI learns how to spot a criminal" is. As scientists, the onus is
   often on us, as the only people with the technical understanding of the
   subject being spoken about, to police such...criminal...equivocation between
   scientific language and the common definitions of words. If Amazon starts
   selling these systems to police departments, *we need to sound the alarm
   bells*.
3. **Don't try to force words on otheres**: maybe you finally feel inspired to
   confront uncle Fred about the fact that his healing crystals can't tap into
   "quantum energies of his chakra" because energy is well defined and chakras
   are not. Don't make the mistake of trying to fight him on what he means by
   "chakra". People's irrational beliefs are their own to live with, and they
   persuading someone to abandon their definition a word, no matter how
   problematic, is typically an uphill battle not worth fighting. What you
   can do is gently explain to him what "energy" actually refers to in quantum
   mechanics. If he independently arrives at the conclusion that it cannot be
   related to the spiritual idea he has of chakras, he is much more likely to
   listen than if you try to force that idea on him. As scientists, we occupy a
   position of relative intellectual authority on scientific topic, and in my
   experience people will tend to listen, as long as you
4. **Stay within the realm of your expertise**: let the climate scientists
   debate climate science. Let the physicists debate quantum mechanics. Admit
   the limits of your understanding, and remember: [being a neuroendocrinologist
   does not make you qualified to talk about quantum
   mechanics](https://youtu.be/hU6TkfCGlX8?t=420).
